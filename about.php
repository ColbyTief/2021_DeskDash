				<h2>What is Desk Dash?</h2><br>

				<p>
					Desk Dash is a technology platform that helps connect students with the food they love. Founded
					in 2021, Desk Dash was the idea of four college ITSD students that wanted to address the gap they
					felt with having food delivered directly to campus more efficiently and always in a timely manner.
